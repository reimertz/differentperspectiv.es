        p Ever wondered what it would be like step into someone elseâ€™s shoes? To see what they see, hear what they hear? How would it feel to experience the world from the perspective of someone of a different gender, or ethnicity, or sexuality?
        p Different Perspectives is an immersive Virtual Reality experience that uses 360 films and Google Cardboard to do just that.
        p Our hope is that the immediacy of seeing a situation through the eyes of another will evoke an emotional response, and elicit reactions that can be shared, and reflected on, in empathy building exercises.
